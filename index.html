                <h3>Our History</h3>
                <p>The Japanese Women's Leadership Initiative (JWLI) was founded in 2006 by three visionary women in Boston, Massachusetts: Atsuko Toko Fish, Mary Lassen, and Catherine Crone Coburn. 
                JWLI brings emerging women leaders, referred to as the Fellows, from Japan to Boston to receive four weeks of hands-on experience and training with successful nonprofit organizations in nonprofit management and leadership development. 
                During their stay in Boston, the Fellows will develop an Action Plan, which will serve as a step-by-step roadmap to make their dreams of social change a reality. 
                After returning to Japan, the Fellows are expected to make a difference in their communities based on their Action Plans. 
                The purpose of this program is for the fellows to share the knowledge and experience they acquired in Boston with other women and social sector leaders within Japan.</p>
                <p>Celebrating the 10th anniversary, JWLI hosted the Tokyo Summit at Tokyo American Club on October 18, and it was a huge success. Nearly 40 women leaders and JWLI Fellows candidly explored the theme of Women Leading Social Change in Japan with the audience of over 300 people. 
                Mari Kuraishi, a founder of Global Giving, gave us a powerful keynote speech sharing her journey to start the organization. The Summit showcased JWLI's 10-year impact by highlighting 10 alumnae and their achievements. 
                Under the theme of Women Leading Social Change in Japan, the Summit’s most important message to the participants was to take action and be a leader to make positive social change in Japan.</p>

                <h4>Atsuko Toko Fish - Founder</h4>
                <p>Atsuko Toko Fish retired as a U.S.-Japan cross-cultural consultant, and is currently involved with various social innovative movements as a philanthropist. 
                She is also a founding trustee of the Fish Family Foundation. 
                To accelerate social change by women leaders, Atsuko founded the Champion of Change Japan Award (CCJA) in 2017 and is launching the JWLI Bootcamp in June, 2019. 
                In the wake of 3.11, Atsuko established the Japanese Disaster Relief Fund-Boston (JDRFB) to support immediate and mid-term recovery in Tohoku. 
                Atsuko visited the effected region several times to assess and evaluate the fast-changing needs of the people and community. 
                In the two years the fund was active for, JDRFB raised approximately $1 million and distributed 24 grants to 19 organizations and projects working directly in Tohoku. 
                It has been reported by the grantees that JDRFB's $1 million grants were leveraged for $6 million of economic impact.</p>
